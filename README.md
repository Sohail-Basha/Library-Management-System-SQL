# Library-Management-System-SQL
This project is a Library Management System built using SQL. It uses multiple datasets related to books, authors, borrowers, and library branches to manage and analyze library data.

## Overview
This project is a Library Management System created using SQL.
It manages and analyzes library data such as books, authors,
borrowers, book loans, and library branches.
The project shows how SQL can be used to handle real-world
database systems like libraries.

---

## Problem Statement
Libraries handle a lot of data every day, such as:
- Book details
- Borrower information
- Book issue and return records
- Library branches

Managing this data manually is difficult.
This project uses SQL to store, manage, and analyze library data
in an organized way.

---

## Datasets Used
The project uses multiple datasets related to a library system:

- authors.csv → Author details  
- books.csv → Book information  
- publisher.csv → Publisher details  
- borrower.csv → Library member information  
- library_branch.csv → Library branch details  
- book_copies.csv → Number of book copies per branch  
- book_loans.csv → Book issue and return records  

These datasets are connected using primary and foreign keys.

## Tools Used
- SQL
- Relational Database
- CSV datasets

---

## SQL Concepts Used
- SELECT queries
- WHERE conditions
- ORDER BY
- GROUP BY
- Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM)
- JOINS (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN)
- Subqueries

---

## Project Features
- View available books in the library
- Track borrowed and returned books
- Manage borrower details
- Check book copies in different branches
- Analyze book loan records

---

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Import the CSV files into a SQL database
3. Open the `Project SQL.sql` file
4. Run the queries to create tables and analyze data
5. View the results for insights

---

## Output
- List of books and authors
- Borrower and loan details
- Book availability across branches
- Summary reports using SQL queries

---

## Future Improvements
- Add more datasets
- Create a user interface
- Connect SQL with Python
- Add reports and dashboards

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how SQL is used to build and manage
a real-world Library Management System.
It highlights strong database design and SQL query skills.
